# Module 5: Second-order analysis and data exploration
Welcome to your practical assessment for Module 5 of MIT Big Data and Social Analytics.


## Objective
This module introduces data exploration and visualization techniques using Bandicoot. It also introduces machine learning, in which you will build a predictive model (using Bandicoot features obtained from mobile phone metadata) to predict the socio-economic group to which an individual belongs.

Engage with the mentor team and fellow students in the forums to get help, and share your insights and learning experiences.

We hope that you enjoy this course, and that you will acquire and refine skills that are of use to you in your personal journey.

# Notebook 1: Introduction to Bandicoot
> **Notebook goal:** Create and visualize mobile phone metadata features using Bandicoot, and understand error handling in data.

In this notebook, you will revisit Bandicoot, a complete, easy-to-use Python environment for analyzing mobile phone metadata. Using the "Friends and Family" data set, you will learn how Bandicoot automates the analytical pipeline, for data exploration and the generation of behavioral indicators.

####  List of exercises:
>- **Exercise 1:** Calculating the number of call contacts.
- **Exercise 2:** Determining average day and night weekly call activity rates.
- **Exercise 3:** Interpreting gender assortativity values.
- **Exercise 4:** Handling data errors.

# Notebook 2: Predictive modeling using Bandicoot features
> **Notebook goal:** Construct predictive models using Bandicoot features generated from the "Friends and Family" data set.

You will be introduced to the concept of machine learning, and how to fit predictive models using machine learning algorithms. Using a binary classification model, you will be introduced to confusion matrices (and associated metrics), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, both of which assist in the assessment and interpretation of the fitted models.

####  List of exercises:
>- **Exercise 1:** Machine learning concepts.
- **Exercise 2:** Simple ROC curve interpretation.
- **Exercise 3:** Interpreting results of binary classification model.
- **Exercise 4:** Analysis of ROC curves and general model improvement strategies.
- **Exercise 5 [Advanced]:**  Building a *k*-nearest neighbor classification model.
