# Welcome to the MIT Big Data and Social Analytics certificate course.

# Module 1: Foundations of big data and social physics

After working through the video content and exercises on big data and its applications, social physics, data quality, and data privacy, you will work on your practical assessments.

The practical portion of this course has been positioned to enable you to complete hands-on activities in order to extend your theoretical understanding of the content introduced. You will acquire new skills and will be able to download and reuse the notebooks provided to help you get started.

Jupyter Notebooks facilitate the learning experience by offering the ability to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. Combining data, code, visualizations, and formatted text in a single platform can be extremely powerful when you need to communicate with varying stakeholders. Advanced users will likely find value in specific code sections or libraries used, while new users will be provided with functional examples of each of the steps that they will need to complete the exercises. The notebooks can be downloaded and reused after completing the course, should you wish to reference the syntax or change the input data sets and perform similar analyses on your own data sets.

During Module 1, you will be provided with three notebooks, which will introduce you to Python and the basic data analysis libraries. The focus will then shift from programming and syntax to the useful examples aligned with the video content and additional resources in subsequent modules.

Engage with the mentor team and fellow students in the forums to get help, and share your insights and learning experiences.

We hope that you enjoy this course, and that you will acquire and refine skills that are of use to you in your personal journey.

## Notebook 1: Python introduction
This notebook provides an introduction to the programming language, Python. There will be some intense learning for non-technical users. Keeping in mind that this is not a Python course, the aim is to tackle the most challenging task first. There is a significant amount of content covered in this notebook, but the exercises are kept to a minimum. In future modules, you will be provided with sample scripts where you will need to apply minor changes (such as parameter changes), add or change group by clauses, and, in some cases, combine sections of code to produce the desired results. The intention of the first notebook is to provide you with enough background to be able to perform these activities.

> **Notebook goal**: Outline how Python can be used as a tool for computer programming.

> **List of exercises**:

> - Exercise 1: Printing strings.

> - Exercise 2: Rolling Dice.

> - Exercise 3: Coin flip distribution.

## Notebook 2: Data analysis basics
This notebook introduces some of the libraries and concepts that you will use in future. The examples are based on examples from Python documentation, the specific libraries used or, in some cases, on data sets that you will encounter in future modules. They demonstrate specific tasks, and provide you with reference links where you can obtain additional information, should you wish to explore additional options.

> **Notebook goal**: Outline how Pandas can be used as a tool for representing and manipulating data.

> **List of exercises**:

> - Exercise 1: Working with DataFrames.

> - Exercise 2: Data exploration.

> - Exercise 3: Matplotlib.

## Notebook 3: Visual communication
Once you have mastered a task, you will be able to make it seem effortless to others. This notebook guides you through a rudimentary example where you start with a basic data set, perform some transformations, use libraries to retrieve external information, and then visualize said information. While the task performed is basic, its aim is to illustrate how powerful the combination of data, a rich community of libraries, and visualization options within a single document can be, if used correctly. Users who have performed this type of action previously are encouraged to think about the amount of tools and resources that are required to both perform the action and communicate the results to their intended audiences.

> **Notebook goal**: Illustrate further examples of representing and manipulating data in Python, and using markdown.

> **List of exercises**:

> - Exercise 1: Plot student count.

> - Exercise 2: Markdown.
