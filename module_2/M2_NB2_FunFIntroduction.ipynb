    "1. [Friends and Family](http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/friendsdataset.html) by MIT Media Lab; and \n",
    "2. [Student-Life](http://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/dataset.html) by Dartmouth College. \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Friends and Family\" data set was generated using Funf. The \"Student-Life\" data set contains similar data and, while not created using it, Funf is quoted as one of its main sources of inspiration. You can read more about the data sets in the provided links.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**:\n",
    ">[Funf](https://github.com/OpenSensing/funf-core-android) was introduced to you in the video content of this module. You are welcome to review the code on GitHub, and download and create your own application. Should you wish to do so, it is a good idea to start with this [Wi-Fi Scanner Tutorial](https://github.com/funf-org/funf-core-android/wiki/WifiScannerTutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercises that follow, you will familiarize yourself with some of the key features of the two data sets. The first exercise will focus on social features: call logs and SMS. In the second exercise, you will visualize the mobility trace for a user over a week. In the third exercise, you will extend the time period to a longer term.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous other features that can be explored in the data sets. Many of them are labeled as “technical”, as a certain degree of data wrangling is required before they can be used to analyze networks of social interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The features demonstrated and contained in the datasets do not form a comprehensive list of all the possible sensor datasets. Additional options include accelerometer data used by fitness trackers, “screen on\" status, and many others. When analyzing populations you will most likely start with the basics. You will then expand on these basics by merging additional features from other data sets (where available) that are potentially useful in addressing the particular problem that you are interested in."
