You will likely have specific patterns of execution, that you typically repeat frequently,  which either do not exist, or are unknown to you.

    "### 2.2 The shape of data\n",
    "Before demonstrating the concept of bias and variance (noise), it is instructive to introduce some basic statistical concepts used to describe data. In statistics, a distribution is used to capture the notion of the shape of a data set or variable. Formally, a distribution is a description of the relative number of times each possible outcome will occur in a number of trials. There exist a number of statistical distributions, which are expressed using a mathematical equation that describes the shape, for describing a data set's underlying generating mechanism. The most common of these is the [normal distribution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html) that is described by a bell curve shape. Comparing statistical estimates from an observed data set fitted to some assumed distribution is an important technique that helps to detect abnormal trends and occurrences in the data. Visualization of the data helps to reveal the deviation of data from a trend, or detect anomalous patterns in a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution referred to above is used to describe data that tends to cluster around a central value, with no bias for values to the left or right of the central value. In other words, 50% of the values occur below the central value, and 50% above the central value. The central value is referred to as the *mean* or *average*. In Module 1, you may recall the following example that used normal distribution to generate and plot IQ data in a histogram.\n"
